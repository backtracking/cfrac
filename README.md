# Continued Fractions

This is an OCaml implementation of real numbers using continued
fractions. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction for
instance.

In particular, this library implements ideas from "Continued Fraction
Arithmetic" by Bill Gosper (1972).  See
https://perl.plover.com/classes/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt for more
details.

Have a look at [this file](test.ml) for a few examples.
